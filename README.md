# LineCounter

Visual line number color indicator to help keep your files under 200 lines.

## Features

LineCounter automatically colors line numbers with a gradient background as your file approaches and exceeds 200 lines:

- **Lines 120-149**: Yellow gradient (early warning)
- **Lines 150-179**: Orange gradient (caution)
- **Lines 180-199**: Dark orange/red gradient (warning)
- **Lines 200+**: Red gradient (danger zone)

The extension uses 10 distinct gradient steps for smooth visual feedback with rounded, semi-transparent backgrounds that don't interfere with code readability.

## Usage

No configuration needed. The extension activates automatically and monitors all open files in real-time.
